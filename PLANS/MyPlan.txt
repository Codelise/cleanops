What I'm thinking about this Inefficient Solid Waste Collection was:
FOR USERS:
- Users can get the posted schedules of waste collection on their respective baranggay
- Users can get notifications via email since its a Web App for now about the schedule of waste collection on their respective baranggay
- Users can see the lists of penalties if they broke the waste law
- Users can file a report via photo, capture image about a trash that's been thrown out everywhere
- Users can also contact LGU to collect their waste from their home
- Users can see real time location of the Waste Collector

FOR ADMINS OR LGU's:
- LGU's can see the list of users on their respective baranggay
- LGU's can set schedule, update or delete about the waste collection on their specific baranggay
- LGU's can provide real time chat with users about contacting them to collect the users waste from their home
- LGU's can respond to the reports from the user about trash
- LGU's can provide real time location to the users by using their phone's GPS
- LGU's can send email alerts when the waste collection will be tommorow
- LGU's can file a report on the people who broke the waste law and received the corresponding penalty
- LGU's can have a weekly report about the waste collection using an AI model like (Gemini, OpenAi, etc).


I WILL USE ES6 Modules for better JavaScript Files organization
